                            Letâ€™s very briefly explain the difference between Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality
                            first. VR (Virtual Reality) puts you in an artificial real 3D environment, whereas AR
                            (Augmented Reality) overlays digital information on the real world environments.

                            Virtual Reality is one of those technologies that will be widely used in the future. Imagine
                            yourself at home with your headgear on! With VR you will have a real-time fully immersed 3-D
                            experience. When tickets for the game are sold out, no worries, VR will come to the rescue
                            and it will be like you are in the stadium! There are even experiments going on where you
                            will have the social experience as well together with others.

                            those technologies that is likely to become increasingly popular in the future as it gives

                            What about refereeing? It helps the Video Assistant Referee. but think also for purposes
                            like training analysis, for analysts on TV or just for you at home to have a view from a
                            different angle.
