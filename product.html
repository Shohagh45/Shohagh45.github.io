                    <h2>Global Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you want to know how many sprints you made, what your heatmap looks like and how fast you run
                        during a football match, the Catapult Playr Smart Football Tracker might be just for you. This
                        FIFA authorized wearable GPS tracker sits in a vest which is worn by the player during a
                        football match. It helps to analyze and improve the performance of the football players while
                        enabling them to view their speed, distance, power, sprint distance, load, intensity, and
                        positioning on their smartphone using an intuitive app.

                        sprint distance, top speed and more. Aim for personalized targets based on your session type and
                        schedule to optimize your performance and recovery. Use heatmaps and directional tracking of
                        runs to understand and improve your on-field positioning and tactics. Follow your trends to
